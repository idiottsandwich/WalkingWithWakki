Walking With Wakki is an exercise-tracking app which involves interaction with a virtual pet, "Wakki." The app allows users to create a login profile and name their pet. The user can then start a 'Workout,' which records walk distance via GPS and returns a calculated score. 

Instructions for using:
1) Download files from repository (EC327AndroidApp folder)
2) Open in Android Studio
3) Deploy to Android Virtual Device, (SDK version 26 and Android 8.0 for best results), or Android device with GPS plugged in via USB
4) Allow location services 
5) Follow in-app instructions!
